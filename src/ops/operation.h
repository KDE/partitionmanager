/** Base class of all Operations.

	An Operation serves two purposes: It is responsible for modifying the device preview to show the
	user a state as if the Operation had already been applied and it is made up of Jobs to actually
	perform what the Operation is supposed to do.

	Most Operations just run a list of Jobs and for that reason do not even overwrite
	Operation::execute(). The more complex Operations, however, need to perform some
	extra tasks in between running Jobs (most notably RestoreOperation and CopyOperation). These do
	overwrite Operation::execute().

	Operations own the objects they deal with in most cases, usually Partitions. But as soon as
	an Operation has been successfully executed, it no longer owns anything, because the
	OperationStack then takes over ownership.

	Some rules for creating new operations that inherit the Operation class:

	<ol>
		<li>
			Don't modify anything in the ctor. The ctor runs before merging operations. If you
			modify anything there, undo and merging will break. Just remember what you're
			supposed to do in the ctor and perform modifications in preview().
		</li>
		<li>
			Do not access the preview partitions and devices in description(). If you do,
			the operation descriptions will be wrong.
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't create or delete objects in preview() or undo() since these will be called
			more than once. Create and delete objects in the ctor and dtor.
		</li>
	</ol>
