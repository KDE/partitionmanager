===============================================================================

For releases after 3.3:

* make Job::copyBlocks() work with LVM. E.g. copy real partition into LVM LV.

* find an elegant solution for the brokenness in design that is
  Partition::sectorSize()... Either a Partition has a reference/pointer to the
  Device it's on or the method is removed completely. -- Maybe the
  PartitionTable should reference the Device?

* the file system support dialog is a usability nightmare

* write a setup-kcm in the style of k3b's so that the user can set the r/w
  permissions of the disks there.

* Convert the fs implementations into plugins. Redesign the support-stuff, make
  that more flexible (no statics in the FS classes, some helper class or at
  least an array in FileSystem).

* Add a SMART self test operation.

* Information about file system on a separate tab in the properties, unique
  to the file system in use.

* parse progress information at least from e2fsck and ntfsclone... maybe others.
