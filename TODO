For releases after 3.3:

* add a way for the user to remove an existing mount point

* make Job::copyBlocks() work for cases where the logical sector sizes of
  source and target are not the same. This is probably fixed now. Does not
  work with LVM though.

* find an elegant solution for the brokenness in design that is
  Partition::sectorSize()... Either a Partition has a reference/pointer to the
  Device it's on or the method is removed completely. -- Maybe the
  PartitionTable should reference the Device?

* the file system support dialog is a usability nightmare

* write a setup-kcm in the style of k3b's so that the user can set the r/w
  permissions of the disks there; also use kauth to update the partition table
  in the kernel. that should cover all cases where we actually need root
  privileges now. -- we actually also need root privs for SMART now.

* Convert the fs implementations into plugins. Redesign the support-stuff, make
  that more flexible (no statics in the FS classes, some helper class or at
  least an array in FileSystem).

* Add a SMART self test operation.

* Information about file system on a separate tab in the properties, unique
  to the file system in use.

* let the user specify external command locations and options in the settings;
  use some program and binary management setup internally like k3b has it

* parse progress information at least from e2fsck and ntfsclone... maybe others.
